# data_preprocessing_with_anomaly_detection
Anomaly detection technique is applied to a set of data to eliminate anomaly data. The project is taught by Flare Zhao in his course, "Python 3 Intro to Artificial Intelligence".

The distribution of both data x1 and x2 were visually displayed. The mean and standard deviation of both x1 and x2 are calculated for setting up the normal distribution. 

The EllipticEnvelope model was lastly used to determine the outliers in the data, and the outliers were also graphically shown.
